I'm truly glad to have been able to build my first prediction model.
Here you'll find the data that I used with the python code used to build the model.
The data was taken from kaggle. Here"s the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiyakhalid/flood-prediction-dataset/data
The dataset was already cleaned. I didn't have to clean it that much.
